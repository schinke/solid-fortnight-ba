Rather than simply grinding the whole grain wheat kernel (bran, germ, and endosperm), in roller-milled graham flour the components are ground separately. The endosperm is ground finely, initially creating a fresh unbleached yellowish-white flour. The bran and germ are ground coarsely. The two parts are then recombined, creating a coarse-textured flour that bakes and keeps well (has a good shelf life) (1).","derived":false,"id":16093,"product":159,"type":"Co2Value","unit":"kg CO2 Äq/kg","validCountries":[]}],"commentsOnDensityAndUnitWeight":"","densities":[],"edb":true,"endOfLocalSeason":"None","englishName":"Graham flour","foodWasteData":[],"frenchName":null,"id":159,"infoTextForCook":null,"name":"Grahammehl","nutrientProcesses":[],"nutrients":[{"amount":0.2,"comment":null,"derived":false,"id":5312,"nutrientId":7,"nutrientName":"ENERC","product":159,"reference":"EuroFIR111 Grahammehl","referenceId":135,"type":"ProductNutrientAssociation","unit":"kJ","validCountries":[]}],"possibleOrigins":[],"processes":[],"processesCo2":[],"specification":null,"startOfLocalSeason":"None","synonyms":[],"tags":[],"texture":null,"unitWeights":[]}
