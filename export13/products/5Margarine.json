Sunflower oil has the highest CO2-impact. They did a sensitivity analysis with a worst case scenario for palm oil production 50% from deforestated land and 50% from peat soils. In this scenario the margarine does still not exceed 50% of the best butter. Emissions from milk are at farm gate higher than that of oil crops, mainly due to methane, fodder production and manure handling.
