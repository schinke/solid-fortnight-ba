It is a semolina that is the coarse, purified wheat middlings of durum wheat used also in making pasta, breakfast cereals, puddings, and couscous. In the milling process whole grains include the bran (hard outer layer of grain) and germ, refined grains lack the bran and germ (white flour). In the mill the bran and germ are separated from the semolina or starch (endosperm). The semolina is then ground into flour. The endosperm is milled into different grades because the inner part of the endosperm tends to break down into smaller pieces than the outer part. Different grades of flour can be thus produced -> semolina (1).\r\n\r\nThe milling process for durum wheat seems to be a bit more effort than that of wheat (2)","derived":true,"id":16090,"product":155,"type":"Co2Value","unit":"kg CO2 Ã„q/kg","validCountries":[]}],"commentsOnDensityAndUnitWeight":"","densities":[],"edb":true,"endOfLocalSeason":"None","englishName":"couscous","foodWasteData":[],"frenchName":null,"id":155,"infoTextForCook":"Ist ein Griess oft aus Hartweizen.","name":"Couscous","nutrientProcesses":[],"nutrients":[{"amount":1473,"comment":null,"derived":false,"id":5268,"nutrientId":7,"nutrientName":"ENERC","product":155,"reference":"EuroFIR9681 Couscous","referenceId":131,"type":"ProductNutrientAssociation","unit":"kJ","validCountries":[]}],"possibleOrigins":[],"processes":[],"processesCo2":[],"specification":null,"startOfLocalSeason":"None","synonyms":[],"tags":[],"texture":null,"unitWeights":[]}
