A \"dough packet,\" or détrempe; and a \"butter packet\" or other solid fat beurrage. Common types of fat used include butter, vegetable shortenings, and lard.\r\n\r\nThe production of puff pastry dough can be time-consuming, because it must be kept at a temperature of approximately 16 °C (60 °F) to keep shortening from becoming runny, and must rest in between folds to allow gluten strands time to link up and thus retain layering (1).\r\n\r\n","derived":false,"id":5352,"product":163,"type":"Co2Value","unit":"kg CO2 Äq/kg","validCountries":[]}],"commentsOnDensityAndUnitWeight":"","densities":[],"edb":true,"endOfLocalSeason":"None","englishName":"puff pastry","foodWasteData":[],"frenchName":null,"id":163,"infoTextForCook":null,"name":"Blätterteig","nutrientProcesses":[],"nutrients":[{"amount":1610,"comment":null,"derived":false,"id":5351,"nutrientId":7,"nutrientName":"ENERC","product":163,"reference":"EuroFIR1001578 Blätterteig","referenceId":139,"type":"ProductNutrientAssociation","unit":"kJ","validCountries":[]}],"possibleOrigins":[],"processes":[],"processesCo2":[],"specification":"vegetable fat","startOfLocalSeason":"None","synonyms":[],"tags":[],"texture":null,"unitWeights":[]}
